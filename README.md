# Magic The Gathering - Life Counter

[![Icon Completed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcelJurtz/ProjectStatusIcons/master/Completed.png)](https://github.com/MarcelJurtz/ProjectStatusIcons)

This app is a 2-player lifecounter for Magic the Gathering
Players should be seated in front of each other, since the layout contains identical controls mirror-flipped for both players.
Additional poison-counter can be (de)activated.
Each player can choose the background-color of the individual side.

In the latest release, an energy-saving mode for AMOLED-Screens has been implemented. To use this feature, hold the 'black'-button at the color selector.
