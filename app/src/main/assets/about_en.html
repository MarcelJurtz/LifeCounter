<h1>About</h1>

<p class="marginbottom">
	Thank you for using my app!
	This section contains various information about the use of the application,
	as well as possibilities to support me in my work.
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p class="marginbottom">
	This app supports the card game <i>Magic the Gathering</i> and contains basic functionalities such as the documentation of life and poison points.
	There is also a dice function (1-20) and the possibility to customize various elements to your individual needs.
	In the settings you can define how many lives a game should be started and how many points should be added or removed by keeping the buttons pressed. Each player can customize their personal background color. By default, the colors are fixed to the basic colors of the maps, which can be overwritten in the settings. The app supports both two and four players.
</p>

<h2>Support</h2>

<p>
	I make this app available free of charge and without advertising out of conviction.
	Nevertheless, the development requires a considerable amount of time.
	If you would like to support me in this, I have set up several possibilities.
</p>
<p>
	The entire source code is under MIT license on <a href="https://github.com/MarcelJurtz/LifeCounter">GitHub</a>,
	which allows you to implement possible improvements directly.
	If you have suggestions for improvement but don't want to or can't implement them yourself,
	you can also use the integrated Issues function. Alternatively,
	you can also send me the suggestions directly, for example via <a href="https://twitter.com/MarcelJurtz">Twitter</a>.
	My selection of test devices is limited, so I can't guarantee that the layout (especially for the new 4-player mode) looks perfect on your device. If you have any problems with this, please feel free to contact me with the model description and a screenshot!
</p>
<p>
	I have also set up a number of ways to support my development financially.
	If you want to give something back in this way, I would be happy to use one of the options listed.
