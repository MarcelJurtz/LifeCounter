<h1>About</h1>

<p>
	Thank you for using my app!
	This section contains various information about the use of the application,
	as well as possibilities to support me in my work.
</p>

<h2>Support</h2>

<p>
	I make this app available free of charge and without advertising out of conviction.
	Nevertheless, the development requires a considerable amount of time.
	If you would like to support me in this, I have set up several possibilities.
</p>
<p>
	The entire source code is under MIT license on <a href="https://github.com/MarcelJurtz/LifeCounter">GitHub</a>,
	which allows you to implement possible improvements directly.
	If you have suggestions for improvement but don't want to or can't implement them yourself,
	you can also use the integrated Issues function. Alternatively,
	you can also send me the suggestions directly, for example via <a href="https://twitter.com/MarcelJurtz">Twitter</a>.
</p>
<p>
	I have also set up a number of ways to support my development financially.
	If you want to give something back in this way, I would be happy to use one of the options listed.
